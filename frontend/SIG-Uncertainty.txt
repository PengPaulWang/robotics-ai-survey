How does the Visitors scheme work?
The DTNet+ Visitor Programme provides funding for up to 20 visitor placement schemes over 5 years, including international visitors, industry placements, and research exchanges. The funds cover travel, accommodation, subsistence, and other expenses associated with facilitating and enabling placements, on a Directly Incurred (DI) cost basis. To participate, SIG members or partners propose a visitor placement aligned with SIG objectives. Approved placements are reimbursed via invoice and claim, following DTNet+ and Turing procedures. This scheme is intended to foster collaboration, knowledge exchange, and skills development across academia, industry, and international partners.
